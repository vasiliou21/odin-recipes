    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This oven-baked pasta is a favorite of my children, who request this recipe often.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>2 (15 ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
        <li>12 ounces brown gravy</li>
        <li>½ cup half-and-half</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package dry ziti pasta</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Heat a large frying pan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot pan until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add tomato sauce, gravy, half-and-half,
        Parmesan cheese, garlic, oregano, and basil. Simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in ziti, bring back to a boil,
        and cook pasta over medium heat until tender yet firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Stir ziti into meat sauce, then spread into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle top with mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
